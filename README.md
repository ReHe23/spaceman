## Project Description

A game where the object is for one player to guess the letters of an unknown word or phrase before all the ballons are popped from incorrect answers. Each incorrect answer pops some of the balloons that are holding Mr. Fredrickson's house up. There are only 9 parts holding his house up so be sure to guess the word correctly before that or Mr. Frederickson will be homeless. Guessing the unknown word or phase before all 9 tries is a guaranteed win.
